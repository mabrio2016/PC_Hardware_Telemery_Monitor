...Work in progress...

I am currently engaged in the development of an open-source tool designed to capture computer telemetry data. This data encompasses CPU usage, temperature, memory statistics, and disk space metrics, sourced from various origins. Once the data has been successfully collected, it is transmitted to MongoDB for archival purposes, preserving historical records. Subsequently, the processed data is forwarded to Grafana, where it undergoes sophisticated visualization for analytical insights. 

The telemetry data payload is transmitted to MongoDB as indicated below

I am using Grafana to query the data and dispaly in the dashboard below.
